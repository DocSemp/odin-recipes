# odin-recipes
The Odin Project HTML Foundations Recipes project.

My first The Odin Project project called Odin-Recipes.
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated
an ability to use basic HTML elements, including
paragraphs, some basic formatting elements such
as strong and em, lists, links and images.

Once the project is completed, I will include a
self-reflection below.
