        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Mince</li>
            <li>1 Dolmio Lasagna Red Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Dolmio Lasagna White Sauce</li>
            <li>10 Lasagna Pasta sheets</li>
            <li>100g grated cheddar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180deg.</li>
            <li>Brown the mince in a pan.</li>
            <li>When brown, add all of the Dolmio Red sauce to the pan. Stir thoroughly and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Start building your Lasagna: 1 layer of meat, 1 layer of sheet, 1 layer of white sauce.</li>
            <li>Top the lasagna with a layer of white sauce and the grated cheddar</li>
            <li>Cook in the oven for 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
